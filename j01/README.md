# BlueStacks: An Android Emulator

I currently use BlueStacks which is an app player that serves as a free Android Emulator. An emulator is something that allows a computing enviornment to behave like another one - in this case this software serves as an Android phone (There are other) on Windows or Apple.

The software has functions of the phone at the right sidebar by default. I haven't messed with the settings... Talk about mental model, visibility (Salience or does that thing standout), the way the window of the applicaiton worked didin't automatically resize... 

This app also utilizes virtualization...
