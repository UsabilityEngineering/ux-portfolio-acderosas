# BlueStacks: An Android Emulator

I currently use BlueStacks, an app player that serves as a free Android Emulator. An emulator is something that allows a computing enviornment to behave like another one - in this case this software serves as an Android phone on Windows or macOS (There are other emulators out there that are for other game systems. E.g., SNES, NES, etc).

I currently use both BlueStacks 5 and BluStack X. The latter utilized cloud storage which means storage that isn't on one's computer but rather on their servers. Since I have two instances I have a manager to manage which one should start but this isn't really necessary as the shortcut just launches the app to its given instance - but is necessary to close the BlueStacks app if there is a problem.

The software has functions of the phone at the right sidebar and some functions at the top of the window. The right sidebar can be toggled to be viewable or not viewable. Talk about mental model, visibility (Salience or does that thing standout), the way the window of the applicaiton worked didin't automatically resize...

This app also utilizes virtualization to get better performance but it isn't necessary...



### Competitive Analysis

I decided to use this app mainly because I heard other people using it. From doing some research on other Android Emulators, BlueStacks has quite a few competitiors. The most notable apps include Anbox, Memu, and LDPlayer.  

### Conclusions

The positives: The app provides a much more stable experience than running on my phone since my PC has decent specs... Shortcuts to Android apps... THere is an option to disable ads but 

The negatives: setting up the app player took some time. If a person not experienced with emulation were to set this app up they would encounter problems... The app can be unstable at times and there are certain apps that haven't fully been optimized to the player... A little annoying that some apps have to be on a different versions of BlueStacks (5 vs X)...
