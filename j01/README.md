# BlueStacks: An Android Emulator

I currently use BlueStacks which is an app player that serves as a free Android Emulator. An emulator is something that allows a computing enviornment to behave like another one - in this case this software serves as an Android phone (There are other) on Windows or Apple.

The software has functions of the phone at the right sidebar by default. I haven't messed with the settings...

This app also utilizes virtualization...
