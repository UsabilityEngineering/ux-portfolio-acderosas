# BlueStacks: An Android Emulator

I currently use BlueStacks, an app player that serves as a free Android Emulator. An emulator is something that allows a computing enviornment to behave like another one - in this case this software serves as an Android phone (There are other emulators out there that are for other game systems. E.g., SNES, NES, etc) on Windows or MAC OS.

The software has functions of the phone at the right sidebar by default. 
Talk about mental model, visibility (Salience or does that thing standout), the way the window of the applicaiton worked didin't automatically resize...

This app also utilizes virtualization to get a better experience but it isn't necessary...

The positives: The app provides a much more stable experience than running on my phone since my PC has decent specs... SHortcuts to Android apps...

The negatives: setting up the app player took some time. If a person not experienced with emulation were to set this app up they would encounter problems... The app can be unstable at times and there are certain apps that haven't fully been optimized to the player... A little annoying that some apps have to be on a different instance of BlueStacks (5 vs X)...
