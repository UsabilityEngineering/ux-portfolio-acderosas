# BlueStacks: An Android Emulator



I currently use BlueStacks, an app player that serves as a free Android Emulator. An emulator is something that allows a computing enviornment to behave like another one - in this case this software serves as an Android phone on Windows or macOS (There are other emulators out there that are for other game systems. E.g., SNES, NES, etc).

I currently use both BlueStacks 5 and BluStack X to play games. The latter BlueStacks version utilizes cloud storage which means storage that isn't on one's computer but rather on their servers. Since I have two versions I have a manager to manage which one should start but this isn't really necessary as the shortcut just launches the app to its given version - but *is* necessary to close the BlueStacks app if there is a problem.


The software has functions of the phone at the right sidebar and some functions at the top bar of the window. The right sidebar can be toggled to be viewable/nonviewable. The buttons for the most part are straight forward but if someone doesn't remember what a button does, he/she can hover over it to get the function name of a button and its shortcut. For help, there is a designated question mark button that can be pressed. Sylistically the menu bars are fairly simple and minimalistic.

## APK

Downloading an apk (Android Package Kit) means downloading an Android Program - this is useful for downloading projects such as BlueConnect and helpful for installing and using apps outside of a given person's region without using a VPN. A VPN is a virtual private network and this just allows a person to have access to online services available in a different region. Since I'm in the US I can't play games that are exclusive to a region like Korea. For example, I've downloaded an apk for a Korean game called Trickcal Revive from QooApp. There is a translation shortcut but this isn't consistent as I have to do the shortcut everytime and that is cumbersome, translations sometimes don't work with certain fonts, but most importantly the translation format isn't the best.

## Competitive Analysis

I decided to use this app mainly because I heard other people using it. From doing some research on other Android Emulators, BlueStacks has quite a few competitiors. The most notable apps include Anbox, Memu, and LDPlayer.  

## Conclusions

The positives: The app provides a much more stable experience than running on my phone since my PC has decent specs... Shortcuts to Android apps... There is an option to disable ads but I don't do that so I can support the app.

The negatives: Setting up the app player took some time. If a person not experienced with emulation were to set this app up they would encounter problems... The app can be unstable at times and there are certain apps that haven't fully been optimized to the player... A little annoying that some apps have to be on a different versions of BlueStacks (5 vs X)...
