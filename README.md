# Andre de Rosas' Portfolio

My name is Andre de Rosas. I tranferred over from FLC and I'm majoring in Computer Science. I follow sports with my favourite teams being FC Barcelona, LA Angels, LA Lakers, and the LA Chargers - I'm a newish fan to the SJ Sharks. I watch a lot of movies, read manga, and just play gacha games in my free time.
